# Who Am I Messenger Bot


# Inspiration
Who Am I messenger bot is created to facilitate the mental health education, the motivation behind is my mental health teacher experience. For the lack of time, I only focus on sex education in this hackthon. In my class and many other places, talking about sex is like a taboo despite of the fact that it is a part of us human being. This website https://www.genderbread.org/  shares a great teaching tool to help people understand and tackle this 'tough' subject. A chatbot that provides resources and support in an interactive way can help eliminate the shame and benefit more people.

# What it does
Who Am I messenger bot will:

1. break the concept into small pieces by providing survey and explainer
2. connect user with professional counselor 

# How I built it
• built by Messenger API, leveraging three main features
1. One-Time-Notification: when user wants to talk to a counselor , bot will notify them when there is counselor avaliable
2. Handover Proocol: when counselor is avaliable, pass control to another app and when conversion is over, pass control back to bot
3. Quick Repies: mainly used to generate answers of survey

• built the backend with node.js and JavaScript 
• deployed the server on heroku 


# Challenges I ran into
• I only have 4 days so I do not have time to pass the app review process
• phrasing the interaction to make users feel being supported
• this bot cannot work without professional counselors
